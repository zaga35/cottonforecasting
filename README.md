# Cotton Price Forecasting
This is a simple model that generalizes well, but if I was building for production, I would include additional indicators (e.g. prices of related commodities, fertilizer prices, satellite images, USDA Reports, drought data, etc.) and use principle component analysis to optimize features.

I used:
* Historical cotton price data from Macrotrends
* Cotton yield per hectare data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
* Chemical and textile fiber production volume data from Statista
* Inflation data from Federal Reserve Bank Economic Data.
