# Cotton Price Forecasting
This is a simple model that generalizes well, but if I was building for production, I would include additional indicators (e.g. prices of related commodities, fertilizer prices, satellite images, USDA Reports, drought data, etc.) and use principle component analysis to optimize features.

I used historical cotton price data from Macrotrends, cotton yield per hectare data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, chemical and textile fiber production volume data from Statista, and Inflation data from Federal Reserve Bank Economic Data.
